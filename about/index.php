            <h3>History of the digital calendar</h3>
            <p>I first created the SEC digital calendar files for my own use in 2004 and started sharing it with a few colleagues. There are now people all over the world using it.</p>
            <p>I do it to glorify God and as a practical resource for my colleagues and friends in the <a href="http://www.scotland.anglican.org/">Scottish Episcopal Church</a> (which is in communion with the world-wide <a href="https://www.anglicancommunion.org/">Anglican&nbsp;Communion</a>).</p>
            <p>Source files are available on <a href="https://github.com/garethjmsaunders/sec-digital-calendar">GitHub</a> should you wish to download, clone or fork the files for your own use; please do let me know what you do with it.</p>

                        <p>This volume is an important, revised and updated ceremonial manual, published to guide and assist in celebrating the traditional liturgy today. While this manual is obviously intended for Roman Catholic liturgy there is a lot here that is also useful for Scottish Episcopal Church liturgy, particularly celebrating the Eucharist (said, sung, with sub-deacon, deacon and priest), benediction, advent, holy week services, baptisms, funerals, marriages, blessing of the sick and dying.</p>

                        <p>Church Publishing, Inc. (1998) ISBN&nbsp;13:&nbsp;9780819217684</p>
                        <p>Written from an American Episcopal Church perspective, this volume also covers similar ground to Fortescue and O'Connell, and Elliot. It includes a nice couple of chapters on the calendar and lectionary, and daily office. It is not as thorough as Fortescue and O'Connell but it does offer an Anglican perspective on the ceremony.</p>
