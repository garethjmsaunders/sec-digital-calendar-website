            <h3>Readings</h3>
            <p>The readings for category 4 saints days and lesser festivals are simply those for that day of the week in relation to the previous Sunday rather than specifically for that minor saint/festival. For example, the readings given for Ambrose of Milan (Friday 7 December) are those for the Friday of Advent 1.</p>
            <p>In other words, I've used only readings from <em>The Lectionary</em> and the <em>Readings for Festivals</em>, and not those from elsewhere or from the <em>Readings for Special Occasions</em> or <em>Common Readings for Saints Days</em>.</p>

            <h3>Translated feasts</h3>
            <p>Where possible I have always translated (moved) the festival of a saint, if it coincides with a higher-category feast, to the next available date. When this is not possible, due to no available day, that feast day will be omited for the year.</p>
