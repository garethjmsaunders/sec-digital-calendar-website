you see that we lack the strength to help ourselves:
protect us both inwardly and outwardly;

from such thoughts as assault and harm the soul;

who lives and reigns with you,

and rise with him to newness of life;
through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
who now lives and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, world without end.

The following Collect is used at the Easter Vigil.

O God,
who made this most holy night
to shine with the glory of the Lord’s resurrection:
stir up in your Church
that Spirit of adoption given to us in baptism;
that, being renewed both in body and mind,
we may worship you in sincerity and truth;
through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, world without end."

Almighty God,
who looked with favour on your servant Mary
and called her to be the mother of your Son:
grant us, we pray,
the humility which found favour in your sight;
that we, with her, may proclaim the greatness of your name,
and find the mercy shown to those who stand in awe of you;
through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, world without end.

Almighty God,
who gave such grace to your apostle Andrew
that he readily obeyed the call of your Son, Jesus Christ:
give us, who are called by your holy Word,
the grace to follow him without delay,
and to be messengers of the good news of your kingdom;
through the same Jesus Christ, our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, world without end."
