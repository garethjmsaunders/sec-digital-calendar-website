Almighty God,
give us grace to cast away the works of darkness
and to put on the armour of light,
now in the time of this mortal life,
in which your Son Jesus Christ came to us in great humility:
that on the last day,
when he shall come again in his glorious majesty
to judge the living and the dead,
we may rise to the life immortal;
through him who lives and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, world without end.

COLLECTS (Maundy Thursday)

At Daily Prayer the Collect for Palm Sunday (The Liturgy of the Passion) is used.

Almighty God,
who, in your tender love for the human race,
sent your Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ,
to take our nature upon him,
and to suffer death upon the cross, 
giving us the example of his great humility:
mercifully grant,
that we may both follow the example of his passion,
and also, be made partakers of his resurrection;
who lives and reigns with you, 
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
one God, world without end.

At the Eucharist in the Evening

O God our Father,
as you invite us to share in the supper 
that your Son gave to his Church 
to proclaim his death until he comes:
inspire us by his service,
and unite us in his love;
who lives and reigns with you, 
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
one God, world without end.",
